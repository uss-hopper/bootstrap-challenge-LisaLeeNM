						<p>It's been 35 years since Ghostbusters answered the question, "Who you gonna call?" when the sci-fi comedy hit theaters on June 8, 1984.</p>
						<p>The movie follows three former parapsychology professors and a retired Marine who create a unique business to remove ghosts for their clients. Bill Murray starred as the group's leader Peter Venkman, while Dan Aykroyd portrayed Ray Stantz, Harold Ramis starred as Egon Spengler and Ernie Hudson played Winston Zeddemore.</p>
						<p>The franchise has remained relevant over the years and has inspired a number of related projects, including the 2016 female-fronted reboot, which starred Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. That film, which was directed by Paul Feig, received intense online backlash from fans of the original films who didn't want to see Ghostbusters remade with female characters.</p>

					<p class="text-center">When you see the happy hordes at Comic-Con, the parade of fanboys and fangirls dressed as Vulcans and superheroes and warrior princesses and Hobbits and zombies, it’s easy, at first, to think that what’s going on is all too quaint, fun, whimsical, and childlike. Yes, it’s very much all of those things. It fills in who they are.</p>

					<p class="text-center">Here’s a line you’ll either recognize or you won’t: “This is one time where television really fails to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the weather.” If you don’t recognize this little gem, you’ve either never seen Groundhog Day or you’re not a fan of what is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the last 40 years.</p>

						<p class="text-center"><span class="border border-dark">This film stars Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray as two strangers turned unlikely companions. Their relationship blurs the line between friendship and romance—which is why the last scene, when Murray's character spots Johansson's in a crowd, gets out of his car and whispers some unknowable farewell in her ear, has been such fertile territory for speculation over the years.</span></p>

					<img src="Grand-Budapest.jpeg" alt="grand-budapest" class="rounded-circle" />
					<p class="text-center">“Who wouldn’t want to work at the Grand Budapest?” exclaims the budding young lobby boy in director Wes Anderson’s latest cinematic treat “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” That’s a question we’ve all been asking ourselves ever since the film’s first trailer went viral months ago and delighted Wes Anderson fans all over the world.</p>
